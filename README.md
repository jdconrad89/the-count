# Welcome to The Count

Over the past few years I have tried many different diets and have found that for the most part all of these diet companies held the power and control. If you wanted to lose weight you had to pay their membership fees, buy their food, utilize their recipes etc. I constanly was finding that there really wasn't a way to find out the nutritional information for my own recipes. 

Enter The Count.
